• Install a Pre-Made Data
– The “UsingR” package contains various pre-made datasets useful for simple analyses
options(repos = "https://cran.r-project.org")
install.packages("UsingR")
## package ’UsingR’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
##
## The downloaded binary packages are in
## C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpgZxqr0\downloaded_packages
– The library() function loads the package so we can use its datasets.
library(UsingR)
– The ‘mandms’ is a dataset containing info on the distribution of M&M by colors and price
